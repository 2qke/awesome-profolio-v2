# Hi, i'm <strong>2qke!</strong>
This project was taken and edited from the page shared by the Github user whose information is given below (you can go to the original content here). It is not possible to write all the changes exactly, you can see the differences after installing the web page. Thank you for creating the main template yourself. You can use it as you wish.

### The installation is complete, now all you have to do is change the Discord IDs
Go to <span style="margin: 4px; padding: 2px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; color: #333; font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #ffb303">config.json</span> and take a look.

In addition to config.json, make corrections by searching for the old Discord ID in App.jsx, otherwise the old user's information may remain.

Check and update the Discord ID sections as above. If you cannot get your own Discord ID, make sure that "Developer Options" mode is active on Discord.
